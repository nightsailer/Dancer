=head1 NAME

Dancer - lightweight yet powerful web application framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use Dancer;

    get '/hello/:name' => sub {
        return "Why, hello there " . params->{name};
    };

    dance;

The above is a basic but functional web app created with Dancer.  If you want
to see more examples and get up and running quickly, check out the
L<Dancer::Introduction> and the L<Dancer::Cookbook>.  For examples on
deploying your Dancer applications, see L<Dancer::Deployment>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dancer is a web application framework designed to be as effortless as possible
for the developer, taking care of the boring bits as easily as possible, yet
staying out of your way and letting you get on with writing your code.

Dancer aims to provide the simplest way for writing web applications, and
offers the flexibility to scale between a very simple lightweight web service
consisting of a few lines of code in a single file, all the way up to a more
complex fully-fledged web application with session support, templates for views
and layouts, etc.

If you don't want to write CGI scripts by hand, and find Catalyst too big or
cumbersome for your project, Dancer is what you need.

Dancer has few pre-requisites, so your Dancer webapps will be easy to deploy.

Dancer apps can be used with a an embedded web server (great for easy testing),
and can run under PSGI/Plack for easy deployment in a variety of webserver
environments.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This documentation describes all the exported symbols of Dancer, if you want to have
a quick start guide to discover the framework, you should look at
L<Dancer::Introduction>.

If you want to have specific examples of code for real-life problems, see the 
L<Dancer::Cookbook>.

If you want to see configuration examples of different deployment solutions
involving Dancer and Plack, see L<Dancer::Deployment>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 ajax

Define a route for 'ajax' query. To be matched, the request must have the B<X_REQUESTED_WITH> header set to B<XMLHttpRequet>.

    ajax '/list' => sub {
       my $result = [qw/one two three/];
       to_json($result);
    }

or

    ajax ['get', 'post'] => '/list' => sub {
        # code
    }

=head2 any

Define a route for multiple HTTP methods at once:

    any ['get', 'post'] => '/myaction' => sub {
        # code
    };

Or even, a route handler that would match any HTTP methods:

    any '/myaction' => sub {
        # code
    };

=head2 before

Defines a before filter:

    before sub {
        # do something with request, vars or params
    };

The anonymous function which is given to C<before> will be executed before
looking for a route handler to handle the request.

You can define multiple before filters, using the C<before> helper as
many times as you wish; each filter will be executed, in the order you added
them.


=head2 cookies

Access cookies values, which returns a hashref of L<Dancer::Cookie> objects:

    get '/some_action' => sub {
        my $cookie = cookies->{name};
        return $cookie->value;
    };

=head2 config

Access the configuration of the application:

    get '/appname' => sub {
        return "This is " . config->{appname};
    };

=head2 content_type

Set the B<content-type> rendered, for the current route handler:

    get '/cat/:txtfile' => sub {
        content_type 'text/plain';

        # here we can dump the contents of params->{txtfile}
    };

Note that if you want to change the default content-type for every route, you
have to change the setting C<content_type> instead.

=head2 dance

Alias for the C<start> keyword.

=head2 debug

Log a message of debug level

    debug "This is a debug message";

=head2 dirname

Returns the dirname of the path given:

    my $dir = dirname($some_path);

=head2 error

Log a message of error level:

    error "This is an error message";

=head2 false

Constant that returns a false value (0).

=head2 from_dumper

Deserialize a Data::Dumper structure

=head2 from_json

Deserialize a JSON structure

=head2 from_yaml

Deserialize a YAML structure

=head2 from_xml

Deserialize a XML structure

=head2 get

Define a route for HTTP B<GET> requests to the given path:

    get '/' => sub {
        return "Hello world";
    }

=head2 halt

This keyword sets a response object with the content given. 

When used as a return value from a filter, this breaks the execution flow and
renders the response immediatly.

    before sub { 
        if ($some_condition) {
            return halt("Unauthorized");
        }
    };

    get '/' => sub { 
        "hello there";
    };

=head2 headers

Add custom headers to responses:

    get '/send/headers', sub {
        headers 'X-Foo' => 'bar', X-Bar => 'foo';
    }

=head2 header

Add a custom header to response:

    get '/send/header', sub {
        header 'X-My-Header' => 'shazam!';
    }

=head2 layout

Syntactic sugar around the C<layout> setting, allows you to set the default layout
to use when rendering a view:

    layout 'user';

=head2 logger

Syntactic sugar around the C<logger> setting, allows you to set the logger
engine to use.

    logger 'console';

=head2 load

Load one or more perl scripts in the current application's namespace. Syntactic
sugar around Perl's require symbol:

    load 'UserActions.pl', 'AdminActions.pl';

=head2 load_app

Load a Dancer package. This method takes care to set the libdir to the curent
C<./lib> directory.

    # if we have lib/Webapp.pm, we can load it like:
    load_app 'Webapp';

Note that a package loaded using load_app B<must> import Dancer with the
C<:syntax> option, in order not to change the application directory
(which has been previously set for the caller script).

=head2 mime_type

Returns all the user-defined mime-types when called without parameters.
Behaves as a setter/getter if parameters given:

    # get the global hash of user-defined mime-types:
    my $mimes = mime_types;

    # set a mime-type
    mime_types foo => 'text/foo';

    # get a mime-type
    my $m = mime_types 'foo';

=head2 params

I<This method should be called from a route handler>.
Alias to the L<Dancer::Request> params accessor.

=head2 pass

I<This method should be called from a route handler>.
This method tells Dancer to pass the processing of the request to the next
matching route.

You should always C<return> after calling C<pass>:

    get '/some/route' => sub {
        if (...) {
            # we want to let the next matching route handler process this one
            return pass();
        }
    };

=head2 path

Helper to concatenate multiple path together, without worrying about the
underlying operating system.

    my $path = path(dirname($0), 'lib', 'File.pm');

=head2 post

Define a route for HTTP B<POST> requests to the given URL:

    POST '/' => sub {
        return "Hello world";
    }

=head2 prefix

A prefix can be defined for each route handler, like this:

    prefix '/home';

From here, any route handler is defined to /home/*

    get '/page1' => sub {}; # will match '/home/page1'

You can unset the prefix value

    prefix undef;
    get '/page1' => sub {}; will match /page1

=head2 del

Define a route for HTTP B<DELETE> requests to the given URL:

del '/resource' => sub { ... };

=head2 options

Define a route for HTTP B<OPTIONS> requests to the given URL:

options '/resource' => sub { ... };

=head2 put

Define a route for HTTP B<PUT> requests to the given URL:

put '/resource' => sub { ... };

=head2 r

Helper to let you define a route pattern as a regular Perl regexp:

    get r('/some([a-z0-9]{4})/complex/rules?') => sub {
        ...
    };

The string given is treated as a Perl regular expression with the exception
that all slashes and dots will be escaped before the match.

=head2 redirect

The redirect action is a helper and shortcut to a common HTTP response code (302).
You can either redirect to a complete different site or you can also do it
within the application:

    get '/twitter', sub {
	    redirect 'http://twitter.com/me';
    };

You can also force Dancer to return a specific 300-ish HTTP response code:

    get '/old/:resource', sub {
        redirect '/new/'.params->{resource}, 301;
    };

=head2 request

Return a L<Dancer::Request> object representing the current request.

=head2 send_error

Return a HTTP error.  By default the HTTP code returned is 500.

    get '/photo/:id' => sub {
        if (...) {
            send_error("Not allowed", 403);
        } else {
           # return content
        }
    }

This will not cause your route handler to return immediately, so be careful that
your route handler doesn't then override the error.  You can avoid that by
saying C<return send_error(...)> instead.


=head2 send_file

Lets the current route handler send a file to the client.

    get '/download/:file' => sub {
        send_file(params->{file});
    }

The content-type will be set accordingly, depending on the current mime-types
definition (see C<mime_type> if you want to defined your own).

=head2 set

Lets you define a setting

    set something => 'value';

=head2 set_cookie

You can create/update cookies with the C<set_cookie> helper like the following:

    get '/some_action' => sub {
        set_cookie 'name' => 'value',
            'expires' => (time + 3600),
            'domain'  => '.foo.com';
    };

In the example above, only 'name' and 'value' are mandatory.

=head2 session

Accessor for session object, providing access to all data stored in the current
session engine (if any).

It can also be used as a setter to add new data to the current session engine.

    # getter example
    get '/user' => sub {
        if (session('user')) {
            return "Hello, ".session('user')->name;
        }
    };

    # setter example
    post '/user/login' => sub {
        ...
        if ($logged_in) {
            session user => $user;
        }
        ...
    };

=head2 splat

When inside a route handler with a route pattern with wildcards, the splat
keyword returns the list of captures made:

    get '/file/*.*' => sub {
        my ($file, $extension) = splat;
        ...
    };

=head2 start

Starts the application or the standalone server (depending on the deployment
choices).

This keyword should be called at the very end of the script, once all routes 
are defined.  At this point, Dancer takes over control.

=head2 status

By default, an action will produce an C<HTTP 200 OK> status code, meaning
everything is OK. It's possible to change that with the keyword B<status> :

    get '/download/:file' => {
        if (! -f params->{file}) {
            status 'not_found';
            return "File does not exist, unable to download";
        }
        # serving the file...
    };

In that example, Dancer will notice that the status has changed, and will
render the response accordingly.

The status keyword receives either a status code or its name in lower case, with
underscores as a separator for blanks.

=head2 template

Tells the route handler to build a response with the current template engine:

    get '/' => sub {
        ...
        template 'some_view', { token => 'value'};
    };

The first parameter should be a template available in the views directory, the
second one (optional) is a hashref of tokens to interpolate.

=head2 to_dumper

Serialize a structure with Data::Dumper

=head2 to_json

Serialize a structure to JSON

=head2 to_yaml

Serialize a structure to YAML

=head2 to_xml

Serialize a structure to XML

=head2 true

Constant that returns a true value (1).

=head2 upload

Dancer provides a common interface to handle file uploads. Any uploaded file is
accessible as a L<Dancer::Request::Upload> object. you can access all parsed
uploads via the upload keyword, like the following:

    post '/some/route' => sub {
        my $file = upload('file_input_foo');
        # file is a Dancer::Request::Upload object
    };

If you named multiple input of type "file" with the same name, the upload
keyword will return an array of Dancer::Request::Upload objects:

    post '/some/route' => sub {
        my ($file1, $file2) = upload('files_input');
        # $file1 and $file2 are Dancer::Request::Upload objects
    };

You can also access the raw hashref of parsed uploads via the current request
object:

    post '/some/route' => sub {
        my $all_uploads = request->uploads;
        # $all_uploads->{'file_input_foo'} is a Dancer::Request::Upload object
        # $all_uploads->{'files_input'} is an array ref of Dancer::Request::Upload objects
    };

Note that you can also access the filename of the upload received via the params
keyword:

    post '/some/route' => sub {
        # params->{'files_input'} is the filename of the file uploaded
    };

See L<Dancer::Request::Upload> for details about the interface provided.

=head2 uri_for

Returns a fully-qualified URI for the given path:

    get '/' => sub {
        redirect uri_for('/path');
        # can be something like: http://localhost:3000/path
    };

=head2 var

Setter to define a shared variable between filters and route handlers.

    before sub {
        var foo => 42;
    };

Route handlers and other filters will be able to read that variable with the
C<vars> keyword.

=head2 vars

Returns the hashref of all shared variables set previously during the filter/route
chain.

    get '/path' => sub {
        if (vars->{foo} eq 42) {
            ...
        }
    };

=head2 warning

Log a warning message through the current logger engine.
